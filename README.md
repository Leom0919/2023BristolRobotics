# Texture Exploration Research Project

## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis for our research on human tactile exploration patterns. Our study investigates how individuals perceive and interact with various textures using a single finger.

## Data Source
The data for this study consists of tactile feedback collected from participants exploring 10 different textures. Each texture was evaluated along five perceptual dimensions: roughness, fineness, temperature, hardness, and traction.

## Methodology
Participants were instructed to explore each texture with their finger and qualitatively classify them based on the perceptual dimensions. We recorded the normal force applied by the finger and the speed of exploration during these interactions. Statistical analysis, including Spearman's rank correlations, was conducted to link these physical actions to perceived texture qualities.

## Findings
Our analysis revealed significant correlations between the physical exploration actions and the perceived texture attributes. These findings suggest that humans adapt their tactile exploration strategies based on the features of the textures.
